This code uses a simple neural network build using py.torch, where the agent is trained under two conditions. We geenrate the holes randomly and for each iterations the trajectory it follows to get rewards might change.
There are only 40 Episodes, greater the episode more time and power it requires to cover all the episodes to find the path that gives the reward.
